Current global goals:
	Add licensing/copyright information to all files

Current kernel goals (in order of priority):
	Add support for ACS combat
	 -CombatSimulation should include a unified method for pitting any number of fleets in a battle

	Clean up data flow... there are too many damn Result classes and wrappers

	Full averaged combat reports (with ACS support)
	 -Part of SimulationResult

	Implement a proper logging system 
	Unified error framework
	Multithread the combat simulations
	 -N threads do sims/N simulations each, synchronize the SimulationResult
	Defense rebuilding estimates
	 -Part of SimulationResult
	Simulation intent object
	 -Saving simulation intent to XML (fleet by reference or by value?)
	
	Settings
	 -Defense into debris
	 -debris ratio(s)

Current client (android) goals:
	exist

	Hierarchy of activities:
		Combat:
			Fleet selection
			 -List of available fleets, select attack/defend/neither
			 -Shows fleet name, number of ships (military/civilian/defense?)
			 -Scrolling gridlayout? 2 columns
				Clicking a fleet opens a new activity to edit fleet
				 -Should have every type of ship and defense in entities.xml, and allow any number of them.
				  if the user crashes the program or has 15 shield domes it's their own fault
				 -Should also have tech levels PER FLEET so that ACS is calculated correctly
			Simulate/results
			Save/load simulation
		Non-combat:
				
	
	Hierarchy of settings:
		Combat:
			Defense to debris
			debris ratio(s)
