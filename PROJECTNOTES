	Multithread the combat simulations
		Macro/micro?

	Simulation intent object
	Saving simulation intent to XML (fleet by reference or by value?)
	Implement a proper logging system
	
	Settings
		Defense into debris

	Hierarchy of activities:
		Combat:
			Fleet selection
			 -List of available fleets, select attack/defend/neither
			 -Shows fleet name, number of ships (military/civilian/defense?)
			 -Scrolling gridlayout? 2 columns
				Clicking a fleet opens a new activity to edit fleet
				 -Should have every type of ship and defense in entities.xml, and allow any number of them.
				  if the user crashes the program or has 15 shield domes it's their own fault
				 -Should also have tech levels PER FLEET so that ACS is calculated correctly
			Simulate/results
			Save/load simulation
		Non-combat:
				
	
	Hierarchy of settings:
		Combat:
